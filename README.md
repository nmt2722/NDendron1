## Experimenting with Dendron
### To publish your Dendron notes to GitHub as GitHub pages, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub and initialize it with a README file.
2. Install the Dendron CLI by running 
```npm install -g @dendronhq/dendron-cli```
in your terminal.
3. In your Dendron workspace, run dendron-cli export to export your notes as Markdown files.
4. Copy the exported files to the local copy of your GitHub repository.
5. Commit and push the changes to GitHub.
6. Go to the settings of your repository and enable GitHub Pages.
7. Select the branch you want to use for GitHub Pages (usually gh-pages or master).
8. Once the site is built, you can access it by visiting https://<your-username>.github.io/<repository-name>/.
9. You can also use a tool like dendron-gh-pages that automate the process of publishing your notes to GitHub pages.
